### What's JWT?

**JSON Web Tokens** are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.
